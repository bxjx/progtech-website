    <p>We're building skilled tech capacity for organisations across the progressive movement. RSVP here for upcoming trainings, including: </p>
    <Heading variant="highlight.pink">Data automations with Zapier & custom webhooks</Heading>
    <p><strong>Session 1: Getting started with Zapier, Thursday 22 October 11am - 12.30pm</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Session 2: Zapier automations using webhooks and custom API requests, Thursday 29 October 11am - 12.30pm</strong></p>
    <p>Many organisations are using out-of-the-box tools that don't integrate well. It's frustrating working with siloed data and having to repeat processes that could be automated. This training course will run over 2 sessions. The first session is an intro to using Zapier to connect commonly-used platforms, and the second session will teach you how to use webhooks and custom API requests in Zapier for custom integrations.</p>

    <Heading mt={4} variant="highlight.pink">Intro to data science</Heading>
    <p><strong>Wednesday 4 November, 5-6pm</strong></p>
    <p>Everyone is excited about data science but a lot of orgs arenâ€™t in a position to take advantage of it. This session will introduce data science concepts for campaigning, and start a convo about the kinds of data science projects we might like to work on collectively.</p>

    <p>More coming soon! Please note that these trainings are for the volunteers and staff of network members only.
