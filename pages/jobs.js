    <p>
      <strong>About the Progressive Tech Network</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    We are a network of progressive campaigning organisations, tech providers, agencies and individuals teaming up on tech to win. We’re building a world where progressive organisations and activists have the best tools possible, and the skills and support to use them to win.</p>

    <p>To realise our ambition, we are:</p>
      <ol><li><strong>Building community</strong> - building a networked community of people working in, or adjacent to, tech across the progressive sector in Australia. This involves online spaces, networking and socials for tech and digital staff, a library of shared code and resources, and a regularly updated map of tech work happening across the sector.</li>
<li><strong>Developing our people and creating pathways into tech</strong> - running tech training, workshops and mentorship programs to build the capacity of women, people of colour and people working for smaller organisations and grassroots groups.</li>
<li><strong>Widening access to tech</strong> - drawing on the skills of techies in the private sector to build, provide and deploy tech and fixes to grassroots organisations.</li>
<li><strong>Driving collaboration</strong> - identifying and connecting organisations with similar tech needs and facilitating collaboration on joint work.</li></ol>
<p>This project is the first of its kind in Australia, although similar models exist overseas, including the Progressive Coders Network (US), The Movement Cooperative (US) and the OPEN Tech Network (international).
</p>
<p>The Progressive Tech Network (Progtech) is a project of Australian Progress.</p>

    <Heading variant="highlight.green">About the role</Heading>
    <p>
    The Progtech Network Director will deliver against our mission to build the tech and digital infrastructure and capability across civil society. The Network Director will lead work to significantly scale up social change organisations’ technological expertise and infrastructure, including development of an open-source library of tech, training and mentoring programs, pathways into tech for people from diverse backgrounds, and a nationwide online network.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Founding Network Director brings extensive understanding of the tech and digital infrastructure needs of civil society, and experience working in a senior tech or digital organiser role. They will have the ability to shape, lead and grow Progtech in a long term, sustainable resource for civil society.
    </p>
    <p>
    The Director will provide strategic leadership and day-to-day project management of Progtech. They will have oversight from an elected board of network members who will help shape project strategy and priorities, and report to Australian Progress Impact Director.
    </p>



    <Heading variant="highlight.purple">Responsibilities</Heading>
    <p >
    The ProgTech Network Director will be responsible for the following pieces of work. You’ll be supported by an active and engaged board, and the Australian Progress team, to achieve our shared goals.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Building and managing a diverse community of experienced and emerging technologists, digital experts and organisational partners, including building an online community of 200 tech and digital staff, establishing a library for shared code and resources, and creating space for troubleshooting and sharing expertise.</li>
      <li>Increasing tech skills across the sector - there are significant gaps in organisations’ tech capacity and a long list of experts willing to share their skills through training and mentoring for tech and digital staff, and grassroots campaigners. The Director will have oversight of training design and delivery, and manage mentoring and other capacity building programs.</li>
      <li>Identifying opportunities for tech collaboration - the Director will map tech needs across the sector, and identify and deliver sector-wide projects that would be unviable in isolation.</li>
      <li>Increasing access to best in class tech - with a focus on small grassroots organisations, the Director will leverage in-kind tech tools and tech support to set up quality systems and ongoing support.</li>
      <li>Building financial sustainability - leveraging the support of in-kind time, membership contributions, philanthropic support and tech sponsorship to set ProgTech up for ongoing financial sustainability.</li>
      <li>Project and team management - including managing future hires (funding dependent) and volunteers.</li>
